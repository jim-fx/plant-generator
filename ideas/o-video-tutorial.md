Hi, hope you're all doing okay! 

I'm Max and today i am going to introduce you to my hobby project plantarium.

With plantarium you can model plant types and then generate infinitely many 3D Models for those plant types.

The heart of plantarium is the nodesystem you can see here on the right side, if you have never worked with nodesystems before there is a introductory tutorial available here.

We're going to follow the slightly more advanced one where we are going to construct a very simple plant.
