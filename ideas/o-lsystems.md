# L-Systems

A few people mentioned l-systems, but something always irked me about it, and I was not sure what. 
But I think its the imperative nature of them, we provide some parameters and leave everything to the algorithm.

Also I think most of the results I have seen have some sort of "mathematical/algorithmical" look to it.

But nonetheless I think I will implement them, also just to check "learning l-systems" of my list of things to learn :)
